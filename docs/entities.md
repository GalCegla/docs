# What is an entity?
Entities in Amplication are software design entities. A design entity is an element (or component) that's structurally and functionally distinct from other elements and is seperately named and referenced  (source: https://www.chambers.com.au/glossary/design_entity.php#). This means that the entities you add to your app will have a distinct name, purpose and function.
